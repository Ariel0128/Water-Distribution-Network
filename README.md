# Water-Distribution-Network
schedule optimization and cost-benefit analysis
- source, pump, tank, valve all has various constraints.
- extensions: source, pump, valve can only change every 2 hours.

Part 1: Build the most cost effective 24 hour schedule for Suez Town water distribution network, while making sure each tank ends up with the same or similar volume of water as in the beginning of the day. 
You can assume that the day starts at 6:00am

Part 2: Cost Benefit Analysis
- What benefit is there in upgrading pumps to more efficient ones

- The town is in Lockdown 
Due to a global pandemic the town is in lockdown. New water usage patterns emerge. Ellerslie and Penrose have increased in usage (by 50% each), however Newmarket â€“ an industrial and commercial zone is almost deserted (drop of water consumption by 90%).
This new pattern of consumption brings new infrastructure, water quality and optimization challenges. 
How long can the town sustain this change in consumption and what can be done about it?
